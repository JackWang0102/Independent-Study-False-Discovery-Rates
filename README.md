# Independent-Study-False-Discovery-Rates
Advisor: Prof. Chun-Hao Yang. 

## Introduction: 
False Discovery Rates (FDR) are, loosely speaking, the expected propotion of false rejections among all rejections and are widely used in multipling testing, especially in a high-dimensional setup. FDRs can be defined differently such as the positive FDR (pFDR) proposed by Storey, the FDR definied in Benjamini & Hochberg (1995), and the local FDR (lFDR) proposed by Efron et al. There are many methods proposed by scholars to control these error rates in testing in an algorithm fashion (Benjamini, Hochberg, Sarkar,etc) or point estimation (Storey, Tibshirani, etc). Most of the methods are under independence assumptions of test statistics, however there are still some works about dependence cases.

In this study, we survey frequentist testing procedures controlling false discovery rates (FDRs) under independent and dependent test statistics, Bayesian procedures controlling FDRs, and applications of FDRs. The main focus will be on point estimations and independence cases. A simulation study will be present. Note that this project is still in progress. (Last updated: 11/5, 2022)
