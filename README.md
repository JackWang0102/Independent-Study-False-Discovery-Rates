# Independent-Study-False-Discovery-Rates
Advisor: Prof. Chun-Hao Yang. In this study, we survey frequentist testing procedures controlling false discovery rates (FDRs) under independent and dependent test statistics, Bayesian procedures controlling FDRs, and applications of FDRs. The main focus will be on point estimations and independence cases. A simulation study will be present.
